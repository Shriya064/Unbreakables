          <h1>Bobby Fischer</h1>
          <p style="display: none;">Bobby fischer is the first and only american world chess champion in history. He started playing chess professionally at age 8, conclusively won the tournament with a decent score, and became the youngest u. S. Champion when he was just 14. His gains commonly resulted from surprise attacks or counterattacks rather than from the collection of small upper hands, yet his play remained positionally sound. Soon after the candidates tournament in 1959, he dropped out of high school to reserve more time for chess. In 1970, he made his comeback to chess, and after closing with a seven-game winning streak, won the interzonal tournament. His significant career path went through the cold war period and glittered with his exceptional struggle. In 1972, he indirectly worked as an unlikely weapon for the u. S. Against soviet russia. The game of chess between spassky and fischer had come to represent the cold war itself. His passion for puzzles was combined with endless hours of studying and playing chess. His incredible comeback comes exactly 20 years after he won the championship and he played his first pawn. The atmosphere of this whole championship was heavy and transient. With such uniqueness in his game, he ended up on a show. His quiet, straightforward words influenced many generations and it's "chess demands total concentration."

          <h1>Roger Federer</h1>
          <p style="display: none;">Roger federers declaration that he is to retire from professional tennis brings to an end the career of arguably the most eminent tennis player of all.

Federer found his first success at wimbledon as a junior player, winning both the boys singles and doubles titles. He vaulted into the top 15 with his first grand slam quarterfinal appearance. Federer is not only an exemplary shotmaker renowned for his forehand but was also praised for his composure and forthrightness. <br>
          Becoming the first player in history to reach all four grand slam finals in back-to-back years, he is a portrait of the sport. For tennis, he had a style-defining effect and uniqueness in recreating it. Reaching the finals in a staggering 16 of the 17 tournaments in 2006 this season was the premier season of federer's career. Depiction of his career is incomplete without the well-known rivalry between him and rafael nadal. They all became better because of that daily pressure, and federer and nadal concluded long ago that they had more reach as a pair than on their own. After successive failures in brisbane international, his resurgence with major titles like the australian open and wimbledon titles was a real inspiration for the whole sports world. And he said of his failure, "this one is definitely huge because it's centre court at wimbledon". The coep zest team takes pride in applauding this epitome of absolute determination!!</p>
